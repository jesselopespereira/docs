## What is Kriging?

Kriging is a geostatistical interpolation method that estimates values ​​at unsampled locations based on observed values ​​at known points. It is widely used in:

- **Environmental analysis**: Temperature, humidity, and pollution maps
- **Precision agriculture**: Variation of nutrients in the soil
- **Geology**: Analysis of mineral concentrations
- **Meteorology**: Space-based predictions of weather phenomena
